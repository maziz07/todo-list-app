# To-Do List App

A simple web application to manage tasks.

## Features

- Add tasks
- Mark tasks as done
- Delete tasks

## New Feature: Due Dates for Tasks

### Overview

We've enhanced the To-Do List app with a new feature that allows users to set due dates for their tasks. This addition helps in better managing tasks and keeping track of upcoming deadlines.

### How It Works

- When adding a new task, you can now also specify a due date.
- Each task will display its due date alongside the task description.
- Tasks without a specified due date will be marked as 'No deadline'.

### Using the Feature

1. **Adding a Task with a Due Date:**
   - Enter your task in the task input field.
   - Select a due date using the date picker.
   - Click the 'Add Task' button to add the task to your list with the selected due date.

2. **Viewing Tasks:**
   - Tasks in the list will display their due dates.
   - Tasks without due dates will show 'No deadline'.

### Future Enhancements

- **Sorting and Filtering:** We plan to implement sorting and filtering options to view tasks by their due dates.
- **Highlighting Overdue Tasks:** Tasks past their due date will be highlighted to catch the user's attention.

Stay tuned for more updates and enhancements!
